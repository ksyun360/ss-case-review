# Synthetic development case API

Status: Phase 4 includes a tested Fastify API factory and a [runnable synthetic development server](development-server.md). The browser lists, creates, and opens saved synthetic cases through the development proxy. An opt-in route accepts one synthetic original byte stream for a member case; startup enables the route only when the developer supplies a dedicated absolute storage root. The browser can register selected synthetic originals and list registered version IDs and byte counts on a case page. Source-linked review remains pending. Use synthetic fixtures only.

## Construction and identity

`createDevelopmentApi(environment, database, originalStorage?)` lives in `packages/server/src/case-api.ts`. Supply a trusted server-owned environment map and an already-connected `SqlClient` against the migrated case schema. The optional storage argument contains a server-owned private root and positive byte limit. The guarded development startup passes that argument only when `DEVELOPMENT_ORIGINAL_STORAGE_ROOT` names a dedicated absolute non-root directory; startup fixes the limit at 512 MiB. The caller owns migration execution, connection settings, database lifetime, and eventual listener startup. The factory returns a Fastify instance for request injection and later integration; the factory does not load `.env` or call Gemini. The opt-in download route reads an original only after a membership-filtered reference lookup.

The factory calls `readDevelopmentIdentity` before constructing the API. The helper requires every setting below and returns the fixed synthetic reviewer `00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000011`:

| Setting               | Required value |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| `APP_ENV`             | `development`  |
| `DATA_CLASSIFICATION` | `synthetic`    |
| `AUTH_MODE`           | `development`  |
| `BIND_ADDRESS`        | `127.0.0.1`    |

Missing or mismatched settings raise `development_identity_disabled` without echoing configuration. Tests separately cover production, court-test, court-record classification, another identity mode, and wildcard binding. The classification flag records operator intent; the flag cannot determine whether uploaded material contains real records.

The synthetic reviewer represents one trusted local developer, not an authenticated court user. Request headers, query parameters, and case-creation fields cannot select another reviewer. Court identity, roles, chambers scope, sessions, and audit events remain unimplemented.

## Request contract

The API requires `Host: 127.0.0.1:5176` and `x-record-review-client: synthetic-workspace`. When a request contains `Origin`, the API accepts only `http://127.0.0.1:5175`. The API ignores forwarded-host claims and grants no cross-origin access. The client marker is public and provides a browser request safeguard, not a password or authentication token. Local software can construct these headers.

The development entry point validates startup configuration and binds the listener to `127.0.0.1:5176`. Vite proxies browser case, capability, and synthetic original requests during local development. Do not expose the development API through a shared server or reverse proxy.

| Endpoint                    | Behavior                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/cases`         | Returns `{ cases: [...] }` using membership-filtered repository queries for the configured reviewer.                                                                   |
| `POST /api/v1/cases`        | Accepts a JSON object containing only `label`; returns HTTP 201 with `{ case: { caseId, label, recordRevision } }` after atomic case and creator-membership insertion. |
| `GET /api/v1/cases/:caseId` | Returns `{ case: { caseId, label, recordRevision } }` only for the configured reviewer; returns the same 404 for an unknown or inaccessible UUID.                      |
| `GET /api/v1/capabilities`  | Returns `{ syntheticOriginalUpload: boolean }` according to the server-owned storage setting without disclosing the storage path.                                      |

When a trusted caller supplies `originalStorage`, `POST /api/v1/cases/:caseId/synthetic-originals` accepts only `application/octet-stream` and streams bytes through the attempt journal and private original store. The route returns HTTP 201 with `{ original: { caseId, documentVersionId, sha256, byteLength } }` after reference registration. A nonmember receives the same 404 as an unknown case. An oversized stream receives 413 and leaves a failed attempt but no registered original. An unsupported media type receives 415 before attempt reservation. The upload route does not inspect a document format, accept a filename, or start extraction. Default server startup leaves the original routes disabled; explicit synthetic storage configuration enables browser registration after the capability check.

`GET /api/v1/cases/:caseId/synthetic-originals/:documentVersionId` returns exact stored bytes only after the configured reviewer passes a membership-filtered reference lookup. The response uses `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Cache-Control: no-store`. An unknown case, inaccessible case, or absent original returns the same 404 code, `original_not_found`. Malformed UUIDs return 400. Integrity or storage failures return a safe 503. The route does not provide an inline viewer, filename, extracted text, page map, or citation highlight. Treat the route as synthetic development functionality, not court authorization.

`GET /api/v1/cases/:caseId/synthetic-originals` returns `{ originals: [{ caseId, documentVersionId, sha256, byteLength }, ...] }` for a member case. The route returns an empty array for a member case without registered originals and 404 for an unknown or inaccessible case. The browser validates each row before display and shows loading, empty, unavailable, and retry states. The listing does not include filenames, document roles, media types, or extracted sources. The browser does not expose an original download control yet.

Labels must contain non-whitespace text and contain at most 120 Unicode code points before trimming. The JSON schema rejects numeric labels without coercion and rejects extra fields without silently removing those fields. The server trims surrounding label whitespace and generates a canonical version-4 UUID. Initial record revision remains 1; case creation does not upload or process documents.

The metadata API limits parsed request bodies to 4,096 bytes and sets `Cache-Control: no-store`. The optional octet-stream parser passes a stream to the bounded original store instead of buffering the body; `originalStorage.maximumBytes` governs accepted original bytes. Every successful case-creation POST creates a new draft; the API provides no idempotency key or automatic retry. The browser disables the create control while a request is pending and warns users to check the saved list after an ambiguous failure. Add idempotency before any automated retry.

| HTTP status / code                    | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400 / `invalid_request`               | The JSON body fails schema validation or contains malformed JSON.                               |
| 403 / `development_request_forbidden` | A required request marker, Host value, or supplied Origin fails the development restrictions.   |
| 413 / `request_too_large`             | A parsed request exceeds the metadata body limit or a streamed original exceeds its byte limit. |
| 404 / `case_not_found`                | The requested case does not exist or the configured reviewer lacks membership.                  |
| 404 / `original_not_found`            | The requested original does not exist or the configured reviewer lacks case membership.         |
| 415 / `unsupported_media_type`        | The optional original route receives a content type other than `application/octet-stream`.      |
| 503 / `case_service_unavailable`      | An unclassified handler or parser failure prevents completion, including database failures.     |

The error handler returns fixed codes rather than exception messages, query details, or submitted text. Additional parser/error classifications remain pending. Unknown routes retain Fastify's default not-found behavior. The factory provides no source-text viewer, artifact, or membership-administration endpoint; its opt-in original routes support synthetic fixtures only.

## Verification and remaining work

`GET /api/v1/cases/:caseId/text-sources/:sourceUnitId` returns `{ source }` only through the configured reviewer's member-scoped repository lookup. The source contains exact stored text, source-unit identity, case/document identity, original hash metadata, extraction version, stored record revision, and physical page number. Both path identifiers must be UUIDs. Missing or inaccessible sources return 404 with `source_not_found`; schema failures return 400 with `invalid_request`; database failures return 503 with `case_service_unavailable`. The global request marker, Host/Origin restrictions, and no-store headers apply. The browser client additionally rejects mismatched identity, malformed provenance, unsafe numbers, and non-string text before returning a response to a caller. The route exposes no write operation, processes no uploaded original, and supplies no geometry, inventory, or browser viewer. Read the [text-source contract](text-source-storage.md) for trust limits.

`GET /api/v1/cases/:caseId/text-sources` returns `{ sources }` only after verifying that the configured reviewer can open the case. Each row includes source, case, document, revision, original-hash, extraction-version, and physical-page metadata without raw text. The list includes current-revision sources with matching original hashes in repository-defined stable order. An accessible case without sources returns an empty list; an unknown or inaccessible case returns 404 with `case_not_found`. A malformed case UUID returns 400 before database access, and a database failure returns the fixed 503 response. No browser screen or client calls this inventory route yet.

Run `npm test -- packages/server packages/server-config/tests/development-identity.test.ts` for focused checks. Fourteen API integration cases use a real in-memory PostgreSQL test engine to check reviewer scoping, creation, atomic rollback, member-only case lookup, original inventory, synthetic stream receipt, member-only original download, upload safety responses, guarded capability reporting, stored source retrieval, and HTTP denial for another reviewer's existing source. Eleven request cases check validation, request restrictions, payload limits, malformed JSON, and response caching. Seven configuration cases check the development identity contract.

The [native PostgreSQL suite](postgres-migrations.md) additionally checks API creation, filtering, and membership revocation against PostgreSQL 18.6. One native test launches Chromium and verifies a small synthetic file across the development proxy, loopback API, native database, and private storage. API request-injection checks exercise Fastify's lifecycle without opening a listener. The [development server checks](development-server.md) cover startup ordering, pool cleanup, loopback binding, and a separate real-process HTTP smoke run. These tests do not establish production authentication, general concurrency, large-record performance, or recovery.

Complete private-file finalization, crash reconciliation, document inspection, filename metadata, and source provenance next. Add pagination, case administration, request idempotency, complete error classification, and audit records before a shared deployment. Keep real records blocked until court IT approves identity and data handling. Return to Phase 3 at the very end before pilot handoff.
